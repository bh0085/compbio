rna sequences to check out:

Ribosomal alignments:

5sRNA in rfam 
(annotated, aligned)

All the rest in ribosomal rna database 
(old european one has structures...
does the new american one have structures?) 
(annotated, aligned)

Micro Nmir:

rfam has microRNAs
mirBase has mature sequences... in the case of mir1 for example, 
dicer splices the hairpin according to the secondary structure leaving
you with a 'mature sequence' which is used by argonaut for silencing.
Argonaut only uses a seven base subsequence of the mature sequence.

At three levels then, we have differing selection. 2nd struct, mature
sequences and the seven base complement.

RNAse P:
tRNA processing.
Is it in rfam?

Signal recognition RNA:
Nucleosomal RNA
e.g: u12
