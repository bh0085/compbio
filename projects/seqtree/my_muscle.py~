from Bio import SeqIO
records = (r for r in SeqIO.parse("opuntia.fasta", "fasta") if len(r) < 900)

'''Then we create the MUSCLE command line, leaving the input and 
output to their defaults (stdin and stdout). I’m also going to 
ask for strict ClustalW format as for the output.'''

from Bio.Align.Applications import MuscleCommandline
muscle_cline = MuscleCommandline(clwstrict=True)
print muscle_cline

'''
Now comes the clever bit using the subprocess module, stdin and stdout:
'''

import subprocess
import sys
child = subprocess.Popen(str(cline),
                         stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                         stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                         shell=(sys.platform!="win32"))                     
'''
That should start MUSCLE, but it will be sitting waiting for 
its FASTA input sequences, which we must supply via its stdin handle:
'''
SeqIO.write(records, child.stdin, "fasta")
child.stdin.close()

'''
After writing the six sequences to the handle, MUSCLE will still be waiting to see if that is all the FASTA sequences or not – so we must signal that this is all the input data by closing the handle. At that point MUSCLE should start to run, and we can ask for the output:
'''

from Bio import AlignIO
align = AlignIO.read(child.stdout, "clustal")
print align
