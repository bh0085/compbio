covary: For now,  this whole project is basically one big stub. That's just the way it goes.

In the file rna_notes, I have some bits about future directions within which I hope to take the project and some interesting notes on RNAs shared with me by stefan and dave long ago. No harm in leaving it all intact in hopes of returning one day.
