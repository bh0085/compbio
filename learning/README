I've grabbed a few packages for learning in python.

For clustering, I use mply.HCluster, KCluster

For regression, I use mlpy.RidgeRegression, ElasticNet

For svm, I am wrapping SVM light, see: mysvm.

For NNs, try fann (C Wrapped, fast, complicated and fully featured)
    	 or ffnet (Fortran Wrapped, fast, simple)

For GA, use pyEvolve.
