.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhybrid-ss\fR computes a partition function for the folding of the sequence in \fIFILE\fR.  If the suffix option is used, the folding is computed using the energy rules with the \fIsuffix\fR extension; otherwise, it is computed at each temperature from tMin to tMax degrees Celsius, in increments of tInc degrees.  All output files are named with a \fIprefix\fR which consists of the file name with the extension .seq removed.  The partition function and associated free energy at each temperature are written to \fIprefix.dG\fR.  The probabilities of each possible base pair occurring are written to \fIprefix.temperature.plot\fR and the probabilities of each base and each pair of adjacent bases being single-stranded are written to \fIprefix.temperature.ext\fR.  A summary of the options the program was invoked with is written to \fIprefix.run\fR.
.P
\fBhybrid-ss-simple\fR is identical in function to \fBhybrid-ss\fR when the \fB--nodangle\fR and \fB--simple\fR options are used, but \fBhybrid-ss-simple\fR is faster and uses less memory.
.P
\fBhybrid-ss-noml\fR is identical in function to \fBhybrid-ss\fR except that multibranch loops are not allowed.  Like \fBhybrid-ss-simple\fR, it is faster and uses less memory than \fBhybrid-ss\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -n ", " --NA =RNA|DNA
sets nucleic acid type to RNA or DNA.  Default is RNA.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --tmin =\fItemp
sets minimum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -i ", " --tinc =\fItemp
sets temperature increment to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -T ", " --tmax =\fItemp
sets maximum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 100.
.TP
.BR -N ", " --sodium =\fIvalue
sets Sodium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -M ", " --magnesium =\fIvalue
sets Magnesium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -p ", " --polymer
use salt corrections for polymers instead of oligomers (the default).
.TP
.BR -s ", " --suffix =\fIstring
use energy rules with the suffix \fIstring\fR.  Overrides \fB--tmin\fR, \fB--tinc\fR, \fB--tmax\fR, \fB--sodium\fR, \fB--magnesium\fR and \fB--polymer\fR.
.TP
.BR -o ", " --output =\fIprefix
name output files with \fIprefix\fR.
.TP
.BR -r ", " --prohibit =\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR[,\fIk\fR]
prohibit all basepairs in the helix from \fIi\fR,\fIj\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR,\fIj-k+1\fR.  If \fIj\fR is 0, prohibit bases \fIi\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR from pairing at all; if \fIi\fR is 0, prohibit bases \fIj\fR to \fIj-k+1\fR from pairing at all.  \fIk\fR defaults to 1 if not specified.
.TP
.BR -f ", " --force =\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR[,\fIk\fR]
force all basepairs in the helix from \fIi\fR,\fIj\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR,\fIj-k+1\fR.  If \fIj\fR is 0, forces bases \fIi\fR to \fIi+k-1\fR to be double-stranded; if \fIi\fR is 0, forces bases \fIj\fR to \fIj-k+1\fR to be double-stranded.  \fIk\fR defaults to 1 if not specified.
.TP
.BR -E ", " --energyOnly
skips computation of probabilities and outputs only \fIprefix.dG\fR and \fIprefix.run\fR.  This mode uses less time and memory.
.TP
.BR -I ", " --noisolate
prohibits all isolated basepairs.  Isolated basepairs are helices of length 1; that is, they do not stack on another basepair on either side.  (See also the \fB--prefilter\fR and \fB--nopostfilter\fR options below.)
.TP
.BR -z ", " --zip
enforces "zipping up" helices by forcing single-stranded bases to dangle on adjacent basepairs when possible.
.TP
.BR -k ", " --tracebacks =\fInumber
computes \fInumber\fR stochastic tracebacks and writes them to \fIprefix.temperature.ct\fR.  Stochastic tracebacks are computed according to the Boltzmann probability distribution so that the probability of a structure is its Boltzmann factor divided by the partition function.
.TP
.BR -m ", " --maxbp =\fIvalue
Bases farther apart than \fIvalue\fR cannot form.  Default is no limit.
.TP
.BR -c ", " --constraints =\fIfile
reads a list of constraints from \fIfile\fR.  Constraints must be in the form "P \fIi\fR \fIj\fR \fIk\fR" or "F \fIi\fR \fIj\fR \fIk\fR".  These are equivalent to specifying "--prohibit=\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR,\fIk\fR" and "--force=\fIi\fR,\fIj\fR,\fIk\fR", respectively.  If \fIfile\fR is not specified, it defaults to \fIprefix.aux\fR.
.TP
.BR -b ", " --basepairs =\fIfile
reads a list of allowable helices from \fIfile\fR.  Each helix consists of three whitespace-delimited numbers which specify the starting basepair and the length of the helix.  When this option is used, all basepairs except those in \fIfile\fR are prohibited from forming.
.SH OBSCURE OPTIONS
.TP
.B --allpairs
allows basepairs to form between any two nucleotides.  When \fB--allpairs\fR is not specified, only Watson-Crick and wobble basepairs are allowed.
.TP
.BR --maxloop =\fIsize
sets the maximum size of bulge/interior loops to \fIsize\fR.  Default is 30.
.TP
.B --nodangle
removes single-base stacking from consideration.
.TP
.B --simple
makes the penalty for multibranch loops constant rather than affine.
.TP
.BR --prefilter =\fIvalue1\fR[,\fIvalue2\fR]
Sets the prefilter to filter out all basepairs except those in groups of \fIvalue2\fR adjacent basepairs of which \fIvalue1\fR can form.  \fIvalue2\fR is the same as \fIvalue1\fR if unspecified.  Default is 2 of 2.  (See also the \fB--noisolate\fR option above.)
.TP
.B --nopostfilter
Disables the postfilter.  The postfilter, which is enabled by default, removes from consideration all structures that consist of only one basepair.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP UNAFOLDDAT
an alternate location from which to read the energy rules.  The default energy rules can be overridden with files in the current directory or in the directory pointed to by UNAFOLDDAT.  \fBhybrid-ss\fR looks for each file first in the current directory, then in the directory specified by UNAFOLDDAT and last in \fI/usr/local/share/unafold\fR (or wherever the energy rules were installed).
