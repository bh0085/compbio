.TH CT-PROB 1 "@DATE@" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
ct-prob \- calculate probabilities based on a .ct file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ct-prob
.I FILE.ct
.RI [ FILE.plot ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBct-prob\fR reads a set of stuctures in \fI.ct\fR format from \fIFILE.ct\fR and computes the probability of each base pair.  These probabilities are written to standard output, in the same format as the \fI.plot\fR files written by \fBhybrid\fR, \fBhybrid-ss\fR, etc.
.P
If \fIFILE.plot\fR is given, it is taken to contain the expected probabilities for each base pair.  The output is then extended to include for each base pair the expected probability, the standard deviation and the relative error.
