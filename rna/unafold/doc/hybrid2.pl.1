hybrid2.pl \- simulate a one- or two-sequence ensemble of nucleic acids
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BR --B0 =\fIB0
.RI [ OPTION ]...
.I FILE1 FILE2
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhybrid2.pl\fR simulates an ensemble of two RNA or DNA sequences.  Such an ensemble consists of five species - one heterodimer, two homodimers and two monomers - but species known to be irrelevant can be excluded to save time.  In its default mode, \fBhybrid2.pl\fR operates by running \fBhybrid\fR to simulate each dimer and \fBhybrid-ss\fR to simulate each monomer.  It then runs \fBconcentration\fR and \fBconcentrations.pl\fR to compute mole fractions of each species, followed by \fBensemble-dg\fR and \fBensemble-ext\fR to compute the free energy and UV absorption of the ensemble.  Finally, \fBhybrid2.pl\fR runs \fBdG2dH\fR, \fBdG2dS\fR and \fBdG2Cp\fR on the ensemble free energy.
.P
In addition to the output of each subprogram it runs, \fBhybrid2.pl\fR produces extra output in the form of Postscript plots produced wth \fBgnuplot\fR.  The plots are named with a \fIprefix\fR consisting of the prefixes of each file concatenated with a hyphen.  The fraction of each species present is plotted versus temperature in \fIprefix.conc.ps\fR, the ensemble heat capacity (with melting temperature indicated) in \fIprefix.Cp.ps\fR and the ensemble extinction in \fIprefix.ext.ps\fR.  In each case, the file of gnuplot commands is also saved with an extension of \fI.gp\fR.
.P
If \fIFILE2\fR is not specified or is the same as \fIFILE1\fR, or if the two files contain the same sequence, \fBhybrid2.pl\fR simulates a one-sequence ensemble instead.  In this case, there are two species (monomer and homodimer) and \fBhybrid2.pl\fR runs \fBconcentration-same\fR, \fBconcentrations-same.pl\fR, \fBensemble-dg-same\fR and \fBensemble-ext-same\fR in place of their two-sequence counterparts.
.P
Under certain circumstances \fBhybrid2.pl\fR may substitute other programs for \fBhybrid\fR and \fBhybrid-ss\fR.  If the \fB--nodangle\fR and \fB--simple\fR options are given, \fBhybrid-ss-simple\fR replaces \fBhybrid-ss\fR, because this saves time while giving the same results.  If \fBhybrid2.pl\fR is invoked as \fBhybrid2-min.pl\fR, \fBhybrid-min\fR and \fBhybrid-ss-min\fR replace \fBhybrid\fR and \fBhybrid-ss-min\fR, so that the entire computation is performed using energy minimization rather than partition function calculations.  Likewise, if \fBhybrid2.pl\fR is invoked as \fBhybrid2-2s.pl\fR, \fBhybrid-min-2s.pl\fR and \fBhybrid-ss-2s.pl\fR replace \fBhybrid\fR and \fBhybrid-ss\fR, so that a generalized two-state computation is performed.  Finally, if \fBhybrid2.pl\fR is invoked with "-x" in the name (\fBhybrid2-x.pl\fR, \fBhybrid2-min-x.pl\fR or \fBhybrid2-2s-x.pl\fR) all species except the heterodimer are excluded.  Thus \fBhybrid2-2s-x.pl\fR performs a "traditional" two-state calculation.
.SH OPTIONS
Most of the options below are passed to the subprograms to which they apply, but some (\fB--fraction\fR, \fB--Tmelt\fR, \fB--parallel\fR and \fB--reuse\fR) affect the behavior of \fBhybrid2.pl\fR directly.
.TP
.BR -n ", " --NA =RNA|DNA
sets nucleic acid type to RNA or DNA.  Default is RNA.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --tmin =\fItemp
sets minimum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -i ", " --tinc =\fItemp
sets temperature increment to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -T ", " --tmax =\fItemp
sets maximum temperature to \fItemp\fR.  Default is 100.
.TP
.BR -N ", " --sodium =\fIvalue
sets Sodium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 1.
.TP
.BR -M ", " --magnesium =\fIvalue
sets Magnesium ion concentration to \fIvalue\fR molar.  Default is 0.
.TP
.BR -p ", " --polymer
use salt corrections for polymers instead of oligomers (the default).
.TP
.BR -A ", " --A0 =\fIconc
sets the total concentration of A present to \fIconc\fR molar.
.TP
.BR -B ", " --B0 =\fIconc
sets the total concentration of B present to \fIconc\fR molar.
.TP
.BR -E ", " --energyOnly
skips computation of probabilities and outputs only \fIprefix.dG\fR and \fIprefix.run\fR.  This mode uses less time and memory.
.TP
.BR -I ", " --noisolate
prohibits all isolated basepairs.  Isolated basepairs are helices of length 1; that is, they do not stack on another basepair on either side.  (See also the \fB--prefilter\fR and \fB--nopostfilter\fR options below.)
.TP
.BR -z ", " --zip
enforces "zipping up" helices by forcing single-stranded bases to dangle on adjacent basepairs when possible.
.TP
.BR -m ", " --maxbp =\fIvalue
Bases farther apart than \fIvalue\fR cannot form.  Default is no limit.
.TP
.BR -x ", " --exclude =A|B|AA|BB
excludes the specified species from consideration.  May be used more than once, to exclude multiple species.
.TP
.BR --fraction =\fIvalue
assigns \fIvalue\fR of the stacking enthalpy for each sequence with its reverse complement to stacking in the single strands.  Default is 0.1.  To disable entirely, use \fB--nofraction\fR.
.TP
.B --nofraction
removes stacking in unfolded single strands from consideration.
.TP
.BR --Tmelt =\fItemp
assigns entropy to single strands so that melting temperature is \fItemp\fR.  Default is 50.
.TP
.BR -P ", " --parallel
runs the calculations for each species at the same time, rather than sequentially.  This option results in a significant speedup on multiprocessor machines.
.TP
.BR -r ", " --reuse
assumes that \fBhybrid\fR and \fBhybrid-ss\fR have already been run, and only runs the ensemble computations.
.TP
.BR --title =\fIstring
uses \fIstring\fR as the title for plots.
.SH OBSCURE OPTIONS
.TP
.B --allpairs
allows basepairs to form between any two nucleotides.  When \fB--allpairs\fR is not specified, only Watson-Crick and wobble basepairs are allowed.
.TP
.BR --maxloop =\fIsize
sets the maximum size of bulge/interior loops to \fIsize\fR.  Default is 30.
.TP
.B --nodangle
removes single-base stacking from consideration.
.TP
.B --simple
makes the penalty for multibranch loops constant rather than affine.
.TP
.B --single
only sum extinctions for each nucelotide, rather than for each dinucleotide.
.TP
.BR --prefilter =\fIvalue1\fR[,\fIvalue2\fR]
Sets the prefilter to filter out all basepairs except those in groups of \fIvalue2\fR adjacent basepairs of which \fIvalue1\fR can form.  \fIvalue2\fR is the same as \fIvalue1\fR if unspecified.  Default is 2 of 2.  (See also the \fB--noisolate\fR option above.)
.TP
.B --nopostfilter
Disables the postfilter.  The postfilter, which is enabled by default, removes from consideration all structures that consist of only one basepair.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP UNAFOLDDAT
an alternate location from which to read the energy rules.  The default energy rules can be overridden with files in the current directory or in the directory pointed to by UNAFOLDDAT.  \fBhybrid2.pl\fR looks for each file first in the current directory, then in the directory specified by UNAFOLDDAT and last in \fI/usr/local/share/unafold\fR (or wherever the energy rules were installed).
