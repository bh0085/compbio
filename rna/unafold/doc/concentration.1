.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBconcentration\fR computes the mole factions of each species in a two-sequence ensemble.  In a two-sequence ensemble there are five species: one heterodimer, two homodimers and two monomers.  If the sequences are designated 'A' and 'B', then these five species can be labeled AB, AA, BB, A and B.  (A can be further subdivided into Af and Au, representing the folded and unfolded states, and likewise for B.)  The input to \fBconcentration\fR consists of the outputs of running \fBhybrid\fR or \fBhybrid-ss\fR for each of the five species, specifically the five \fI.dG\fR files.  (All five runs must have the same temperature range.)  \fBconcentration\fR writes \fIPREFIX1-PREFIX2.conc\fR which contains the concentrations of A, Af, B, Bf, AA, BB and AB at each temperature.  A summary of the options the programs was invoked with is written to \fIPREFIX1-PREFIX2.conc.run\fR.
.P
\fBconcentration-same\fR operates in the same manner on a one-sequence ensemble.  A one-sequence ensemble consists only of the AA heterodimer and the A monomer.
.P
It is recommended to use \fBhybrid2.pl\fR to run \fBhybrid\fR, \fBhybrid-ss\fR, \fBconcentration\fR, \fBconcentrations.pl\fR and \fBensemble-dg\fR and \fBensemble-ext\fR instead of running \fBconcentration\fR directly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR -A ", " --A0 =\fIconc
specifies the total concentration of A present to \fIconc\fR molar.
.TP
.BR -B ", " --B0 =\fIconc
specifies the total concentration of B present to \fIconc\fR molar.
.TP
.BR -x ", " --exclude =A|B|AA|BB
excludes the specified species from consideration.  May be used more than once, to exclude multiple species.
.TP
.BR -H ", " --enthalpy =\fIvalue
assigns \fIvalue\fR kcal/mol of enthalpy to stacking in single strands, in proportion to the lengths of the sequences.  Different values for the two sequences may be specified delimited by a comma.  Must be used with \fB--entropy\fR.
.TP
.BR -S ", " --entropy =\fIvalue
assigns \fIvalue\fR cal/mol/K of entropy to stacking in single strands, in proportion to the lengths of the sequences.  Different values for the two sequences may be specified delimited by a comma.  Must be used with \fB--enthalpy\fR.
.TP
.BR -o ", " --output =\fIprefix
names output files with \fIprefix\fR.
.TP
.BR -Y ", " --infinity
enables "infinite temperature correction": the partition functions for each species are corrected according to values in \fIA.inf\fR, \fIB.inf\fR, \fIA-A.inf\fR, \fIB-B.inf\fR and \fIA-B.inf\fR.
