<h1>NCBI C++ Toolkit Python Interface</h1>

The Python wrapper for the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=toolkit.TOC&depth=2">NCBI C++ Toolkit</a>
provides a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>

interface to most of the central
portions of the Toolkit, along with some additional functionality
for ease of use and for obtaining documentation interactively.
This interface is produced using <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>,
along with procedures for automated production of input for SWIG
and manipulation of its intermediate results.
<p>
The wrapper provides access to most, but not all, of the functionality
in the version of the C++ Toolkit that it wraps.
Omitted from the public version of the wrappers (but present in the
C++ Toolkit release) are dbapi functionality, which would
introduce library dependencies and is unlikely to be useful to
outsiders; the image library, omitted for similar reasons;
structure-related classes and functions (mass spectrometry-related and MMDB)
because they would significantly increase
wrapper size and are anticipated to see little use; and
eutils functionality which, in addition to being fairly
new, presents some problems for wrapping.  Any of these
might be included in the future, especially if there is
sufficient demand.  Also absent are a few scattered functions
and classes that could not be wrapped, but the vast majority
of Toolkit functionality is present in the wrapper.
<p>
More information about the wrapper and how to use it can be
found in the links below.
The data files used in the examples in the links are provided
with the distribution (you should be able to execute the commands
if you substitute the actual path to your copy of the "data" directory).
There is also some example
Python code
in the "examples" directory.
