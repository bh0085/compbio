This directory contains a Python 2.5 wrapper for the NCBI C++ Toolkit.
More information about the Toolkit and use of the wrapper can be found in
the documentation in the doc/ subdirectory.

The files _ncbi.so, ncbi.py, ncbi.pyc, and ncbi_asn_specs should be
placed together in the desired installation directory.  Often this
is lib/python2.5/site-packages/ under the Python installation, but it
can be somewhere else so long as appropriate configuration steps are
taken, such as setting users' PYTHONPATH environment variable accordingly.
It is also possible to run an interactive python session in this
directory and load the module (type 'import ncbi' at the python prompt).
This is a good way to check that things are working before installing.

ncbi.py and _ncbi.so are the essential files that constitute the module.
ncbi_asn_specs contains ASN.1 specifications and is there to support
the module's Spec() function/method.  ncbi.pyc is a byte-compiled
version of ncbi.py.  Python can generate these automatically when
import'ing in their absence, but installation in a read-only directory
would prevent this, so it may be important to install this ncbi.pyc,
or one that you generate, to ensure reasonably fast module import.
Also included are documentation in html format in the doc/ subdirectory,
example code in the examples/ subdirectory, and example data in data/.
